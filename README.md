# MCD-DA
This is the Matlab code of the multicircle disassembly based decomposition algorithm (MCD-DA) that can be used to train the multiclass SVM;

download and unpack the iris.rar and dry_bean.rar to the current folder, and then perform test.m to evaluate the convergence of the proposed MCD-DA;

perform test_multiclass_SVM_using_MCD_DA.m to test multiclass SVM using MCD-DA;
